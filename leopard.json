            "description": "Undoubtedly the top spot has to go to Yala National Park, the crown jewel of safari parks in the country. This is truly the land of the leopard, with some of the highest if not the highest densities of these amazing predators in the world. The sightings of a beautiful cat walking across the open plains or atop a rocky outcrop is a signature sight in Yala National Park.",

            "description": "Kumana was initially famous as a bird sanctuary with many species of birds nesting in the waters of Kumana Villu. But in the last decade or so, there has been an increasing number of leopard sightings in the park. The legends say the leopards of Kumana are known to be “man-eaters” and the leopards of Lenama (an area in the park) are mythically known to be larger and deadlier.",

            "description": "The park was very popular for its scenic landscapes and walking trails. Subsequently was highly valued as a top birding destination to see some of the rare highland endemic species. In the last few years, through countless visits and patience, this too has produced some unforgettable leopard encounters. The kings of this domain, these predators are found in the deep dense cloud forests and on the fringes of the open plains which are the main landscapes of this habitat.",

            "description": "Poaching of Sri Lankan leopards poses a grave threat to their survival, contributing significantly to the decline of their populations. The illicit trade in leopard parts, driven by cultural beliefs and the demand for exotic products, remains a pressing issue. The leopards fall victim to poachers seeking their skin, bones, and other body parts for use in traditional medicine, luxury goods, or as trophies. The demand for leopard parts, often fueled by superstitious practices and cultural rituals, creates a lucrative market that further endangers these magnificent big cats.",

            "name": "Habitat fragmentation",
            "description": "Habitat fragmentation poses a significant threat to the survival of Sri Lankan leopards, as their once-vast natural habitats are increasingly divided into smaller, isolated patches. This process results from human activities such as deforestation, agriculture, and urbanization, which lead to the fragmentation of the leopard's native ecosystems. As habitats become fragmented, the connectivity between different areas diminishes, creating isolated pockets of habitat that are often insufficient to sustain viable leopard populations.",
